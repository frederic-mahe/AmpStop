Description: “AmpStop”, an “R” package to automate design of blocking oligos. AmpStop can be used by anyone with R and BLAST+ installed on their computer. It requires as input only the nontarget, amplified region and a target sequence database that is BLAST-formatted (an example can be found in the folder "Testing"). By running three R functions, users can within minutes generate a list of all possible blocking oligos, a figure showing how many times each oligo “hits” target templates (fewer hits indicates higher specificity for non-targets) and a ranked list of the most promising blocking oligo pairs.
